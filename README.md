# AdventOfCode

## What is AdventOfCode?
Every year through December, the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) happens where everyday a new Christmas related coding problem is released.

This is a great opportunity to improve your problem solving skills, try a new language, or improve on your current primary language.

## Description
This repo will contain the problems that I solve for each year of the AdventOfCode. 
While I may not solve every problem, I make sure to have my solution on here for the problems that I do solve. This is mostly an 
opportunity for me to look back on the problems I have solved through the years and see my progress/improvement.
